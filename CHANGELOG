v. 0.9.9 - Almost 1.0!
	 - Added rudimentary image support; you can now view images
	   by themselves, but not in-line with the text (yet).
	 - Files load faster!  (At least they appear to from the user's
	   perspective.)  What actually happens is that the program loads to
	   your last scroll point, displays, and then load the rest while you
	   read.
	 - Misc. bug fixes.
	 - New, prettier default screen.

v. 0.9.5 - Added ability to mark books as new (from the Prefs pane).
         - Added user-override for text encodings, which should
	   solve the problem where Windows Latin 1 encodings wouldn't
           display correctly.  Come on, get with the Unicode program, people.
	 - Fixed a bug where the last line of a file would be
	   chopped in half.
	 - Made hideable top nav bar play nice with SummerBoard.
         - Some minor optimizations and bug fixes.
	 - The ultimate fix: changed the button in the About box from
	   "Zowie!" to "Yowza!"

v. 0.9 - Global persistence works!  Books.app remembers where you left off
         in every darn file you read.
       - Added "unread" indicators for easily telling where you've left
         off.  (Only applies to files, not folders.)
       - Cover art available!  Put a "cover.jpg" or "cover.png" file in
         the root level of your book's directory, and it will display in
         the file browser.
       - Delete books from the file browser!  Swipe your finger across the
         book (or directory thereof) and watch the magic.
       - Officially released improved copybookdir.sh, provided by Aaron Davies.
         Thanks, Aaron!
       - Some HTML files with width tags may display better.  This is
         a horrible kludge.

v. 0.8.1 - HTML files from Baen Books (webscription.net) were not
           sorting correctly, despite numbering fixes in 0.8.  Fixed.
           (Talk about an obscure problem...)

v. 0.8 - Chapter navigation buttons on the bottom toolbar!
       - Browsers now use human, not computer, numbering, so chap2 comes
         before chap10.
       - Many minor bug fixes and internal code changes.
       - Implemented some customizations for the bottom toolbar.

v. 0.7.5 - (Unreleased internal numbering.)  New Preferences panel allows
           choice of fonts, among other things.  Hiding of navbars now
  	   optional (hiding on by default).  Added About... button.
           Welcome Chris Born as an official project member.

v. 0.7 - By popular demand!  Arbitrary subdirectories are now allowed
         within the EBooks folder.  Books.app will remember which
	 subdirectory you were in on quit, too.
	 Also fixed an NSUserDefaults-related bug.

v. 0.6.1 - Kludgy fix for wide HTML images.  May not work with all
	   files, but it's a start.

v. 0.6 - Added several nice buttons designed by Chris Born.
         Added Chris Born's invert text code.
	 Added single-tap scrolling up and down.  Single-taps are now much
	 more reliably detected.
	 Some text file conversion finessing--now handles double-newlines
	 as paragraph breaks, rather than just putting a <br> at every
	 newline.

v. 0.5.2 - Text file handling much improved.  This should squash the "txt 
           scrolls to end for no reason" bug and the "txt doesn't appear"
           bug.

v. 0.5 - Navbars disappear when scrolling text, reappear with single-tap
         (or double, depending).  Added plus and minus buttons for text
         size.  Text size remembered between launches.

v. 0.4.2 - Shiny new icon!  Thanks Chris.  Startup now faster if loading to
           browser view.

v. 0.4 - Persistence works!  Occasional issues, but works 99% of the time,
         anyway.

v. 0.3 - Finessed copybookdir.sh
       - File browser now only shows directories, text, and HTML files
       - Beginnings of persistence; will remember when you were reading
         a chapter, but cannot scroll to where you were within the chapter
         yet.

v. 0.2 - Added copybookdir.sh.
       - Changed scroller deceleration.
       
v. 0.1 - Initial release
