v. 0.7 - By popular demand!  Arbitrary subdirectories are now allowed
         within the EBooks folder.  Books.app will remember which
	 subdirectory you were in on quit, too.
	 Also fixed an NSUserDefaults-related bug.

v. 0.6.1 - Kludgy fix for wide HTML images.  May not work with all
	   files, but it's a start.

v. 0.6 - Added several nice buttons designed by Chris Born.
         Added Chris Born's invert text code.
	 Added single-tap scrolling up and down.  Single-taps are now much
	 more reliably detected.
	 Some text file conversion finessing--now handles double-newlines
	 as paragraph breaks, rather than just putting a <br> at every
	 newline.

v. 0.5.2 - Text file handling much improved.  This should squash the "txt 
           scrolls to end for no reason" bug and the "txt doesn't appear"
           bug.

v. 0.5 - Navbars disappear when scrolling text, reappear with single-tap
         (or double, depending).  Added plus and minus buttons for text
         size.  Text size remembered between launches.

v. 0.4.2 - Shiny new icon!  Thanks Chris.  Startup now faster if loading to
           browser view.

v. 0.4 - Persistence works!  Occasional issues, but works 99% of the time,
         anyway.

v. 0.3 - Finessed copybookdir.sh
       - File browser now only shows directories, text, and HTML files
       - Beginnings of persistence; will remember when you were reading
         a chapter, but cannot scroll to where you were within the chapter
         yet.

v. 0.2 - Added copybookdir.sh.
       - Changed scroller deceleration.
       
v. 0.1 - Initial release
