v. 0.5 - Navbars disappear when scrolling text, reappear with single-tap
         (or double, depending).  Added plus and minus buttons for text
         size.  Text size remembered between launches.

v. 0.4.2 - Shiny new icon!  Thanks Chris.  Startup now faster if loading to
           browser view.

v. 0.4 - Persistence works!  Occasional issues, but works 99% of the time,
         anyway.

v. 0.3 - Finessed copybookdir.sh
       - File browser now only shows directories, text, and HTML files
       - Beginnings of persistence; will remember when you were reading
         a chapter, but cannot scroll to where you were within the chapter
         yet.

v. 0.2 - Added copybookdir.sh.
       - Changed scroller deceleration.
       
v. 0.1 - Initial release
