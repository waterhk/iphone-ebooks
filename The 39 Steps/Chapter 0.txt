THE THIRTY-NINE STEPS

by JOHN BUCHAN





TO

THOMAS ARTHUR NELSON

(LOTHIAN AND BORDER HORSE)

My Dear Tommy,

You and I have long cherished an affection for that elemental type of tale which Americans call the 'dime novel' and which we know as the 'shocker'--the romance where the incidents defy the probabilities, and march just inside the borders of the possible.  During an illness last winter I exhausted my store of those aids to cheerfulness, and was driven to write one for myself.  This little volume is the result, and I should like to put your name on it in memory of our long friendship, in the days when the wildest fictions are so much less improbable than the facts.

J.B.
