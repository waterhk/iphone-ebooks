Books.app is released under the GNU GPL.

For more information on installing Books.app, and installing eBooks themselves,
visit http://iphoneebooks.googlecode.com/.

The package should contain:

This README file
The Books.app application
The copybookdir.sh script

Books.app should be copied to the /Applications directory on your
iPhone using scp.  For details, see the above website, in the
Installation wiki page.

The copybookdir.sh script is a Bash script to automate copying folders
containing eBook chapters to the place where Books.app looks for
them.  Install iPHUC, plug in your iPhone, and run:

./copybookdir /path/to/ebook/folder

It currently has many problems, only a few of which are:

- Nothing in the path can have spaces.

Anyone who is a better Bash guru than me, please, please help!

Eventually the script will be replaced by a full Cocoa app for Mac OS
X.  I don't program Windows or Linux, but I welcome contributors.
